Problem Statment: WAP Program to given number is Prime or not.

A]Logic:A prime No is Positive integer having exactly 2 factors.
        e.g: if 13 is a prime,then its only factors are necessarly 1 & 13 itself.

	1> condition: n%i == 0 //true: factors count will be a incresed.
	2> condition: count == 2 // true: no is prime
B]Program:
	package com.LogicalProgram;

	public class PrimeNo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int n= 7;
		int count=0;
		
		for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
			if(n%i == 0)
				count++;
		}
		if (count == 2){
			System.out.println(n+ " :Is a Prime NO");
		}else{
			System.out.println(n+ " : Is Not prime NO");
		}

	}
